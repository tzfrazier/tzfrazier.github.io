# Welcome to Weeknotes
I've had this site for a while and wanted to do something similar to this. I'm in the middle of a job hunt, having recently finished my Ph. D, and so a lot of it is focused on that. I hope to also bring in some ideas and such.

This week was a bit of prep-work, crafting slides, resumes, and covers and the rest. A 2019 resolution is to loose a bit of weight. Now that I don't have to work on my dissertation, I want to focus on my health (and finding a job). To do so I'm mainly focused on diet, and tracking calories.  I've listened to a decent amount of fitness guys on podcasts like [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/podcast/) and [The Art of Manliness](https://www.artofmanliness.com/podcast/), and from the trainers interviewed on them it seems like doing  tracking calories to create limits and walking are going to be my best options to meet that goal. I'm pretty proud that I managed to track all week long without any interruption.
## Monday December, 31st 2018
I've been looking for UX Researcher jobs primarily so a bunch of the start of the week was getting profiles up on sites like [Zip Recruiter](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/) and [Dice](https://www.dice.com/) to make myself easy to find.

I also spent some time on Monday running errands around town with [Jessica](https://jessicadame.com/), who took the day off. We had a shrimp pasta for dinner. Earlier in the day, I switched out the inks from my fountain pens. I try and use only two colors of ink each month. This month is Salix, a blue iron gall ink, and Earl Grey.
## Tuesday January 1st, 2019
Tuesday was a slow day, I was tired from staying up and reading the night before. Mostly did prep paperwork and nailed stuff down. Also, we did some house work. Jessica finished an amazing painting.  
## Wednesday, January 2nd, 2019
Also stayed up a bit to late, and so had a slow morning. I did finish my book though [The Crimson Campaign](https://www.amazon.com/Crimson-Campaign-Powder-Mage-Trilogy/dp/031621907X/). In the early afternoon, I sent some emails, and found out that one of the position I had applied for wasn't going to work out. They did seem to like me though, and were very competent. So I'm hopeful we have the opportunity to work together at some point in the future.  I also applied to several positions that night. I felt really good about that.
## Thursday, January 3rd, 2019
Thursday was a bit busy. I've been trying to learn python for a while now, and for a position I was up for would have to have skilled up pretty fast. Now that I'm done my dissertation I figured I could work on upskilling in this area. My plan for upskilling to be able to do a bit of data work is to master [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/). That should let me be able to scrape, clean, analyze and send data in a format that I can use my existing web development skills to create visualizations.

I'm using [Automate the boring stuff with Python](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-Programming-dp-1593275994/dp/1593275994), for the python basics. I have a few Python eBooks, actually a good bit more then a few, and I'm sure I'll read another one when I'm done with this, but because the book has a focus on tasks involving data, I figured it was a good place to start. The book is published by No Starch Press, which does really good entry level technical books, and is by an author that I've found to be reasonable.

Next, I'd like to tackle [Python for Data Analysis]https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491957662/), though I don't have it. I also finished reading, [The Manga Guide to Statistics](https://www.amazon.com/Manga-Guide-Statistics-Shin-Takahashi/dp/1593271891) on Thrusday. To be truthful though I didn't get as much out of it as I would have liked. The formulas were helpful. I'm going to have to read it again. Probably in conjunction with my stats textbook. I also started [An Introduction to Information Theory](), yesterday which looks to be a pretty decent introductory text. I'm also reading [Rock Beats Scissors] and it's amazing how much Claude Shannon's finger prints are over each book.

Job hunt wise, I heard back from an opportunity I had sent in the previous day, which was nice. I have thoughts about the way labor gains access to the employment market now. I think there's something a bit broken in the way that HR had automated. I also heard back on the position I was upskilling for, which was also a no go. A bit of a bummer, but I am always interested in learning more and getting better, and I need at least one programming language to be able to do the work I want to do, so that will continue.
## Friday January 4th, 2019
Today has been fairly busy, I'm starting to pivot my work to a second tack for job applications, general research and analysis, focused on business, organizations, and law. I redid my resume and will start working on a new cover letter once I get this posted. Also I have a bit of housework to do. Later I will probably fire up the IDLE and work on Python, or read the information theory book.
