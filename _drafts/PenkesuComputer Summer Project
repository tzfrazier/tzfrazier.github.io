This project is a fork of the Penkēsu (Japanese: ペンケース). a retro-style handheld device, designed by [[https://github.com/penk|Penk]]. I found a link to the project through boing boing. These pages document my own version of the project.

The original project is powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a 7.9 inch widescreen display (1280 x 400 resolution), and a 48-key ortholinear mechanical keyboard. Due to supply change issues, I was unable to find a Pi Zero 2 W, but was able to find a Pi Zero W. Other changes will be tracked my [[|fork of the original repository]]. Additionaly, I lacked access to the technology needed to make my own PCB. I subsituted the custome keyboard for a Pancake 40% kit avaialbe [[here|MK Ultra Link]]
