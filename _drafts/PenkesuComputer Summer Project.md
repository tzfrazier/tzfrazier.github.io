This project is a fork of the Penkēsu (Japanese: ペンケース). a retro-style handheld device, designed by [[https://github.com/penk|Penk]]. I found a link to the project through boing boing. These pages document my own version of the project.

The original project is powered by a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, a 7.9 inch widescreen display (1280 x 400 resolution), and a 48-key ortholinear mechanical keyboard. Due to supply change issues, I was unable to find a Pi Zero 2 W, but was able to find a Pi Zero W. Other changes will be tracked my [[|fork of the original repository]]. Additionally, I lacked access to the technology needed to make my own PCB. I substituted for the Pancake a 40% plank based kit available [[https://mkultra.click/pancake-keyboard-kit|here]].

The project as envisioned in the original documentation is advanced and involves access to several different manufacturing and fabrication technologies. The institution I work for has several of these, and there's also a local hacker-lab maker space that has the others. A big reason for selecting this project other than the form factor of the device is to gain experience with these technologies. If you live in a major city you should have access to these resources through a maker space or hacker space. However, if you do not have access, this project may be untenable.
