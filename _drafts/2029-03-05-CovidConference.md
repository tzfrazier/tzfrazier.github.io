A two years ago, I decided to focus, more on writing than on conferencing. Which means I haven't done, much of either. I've also been thinking about which conferences are most important. Every discipline has a few big conferences. In information science, this means [ASIS&T][ASIST]. I enjoy ASIS&T, but submitting for it is a lot of work and I felt the energy writing submission could be better spent elsewhere. In my particular case, writing for publication.

## What is Information?

My attitude changed a bit when I saw a call for proposal for a conference at the University of Oregon. Not do I love U of O, but the conferences title was based on something, I return to often as a scholar of information, "What is Information?". [The call][call] struck a cord with me. I'd done a lot of wild cat small academic/blended conferences, and those especially in the Pacific Northwest, have a special place in my heart. Given the conference and its history, I thought I would throw my hat in the ring.

### Bayesian Definition of information

I have an idea about information that isn't ready for prime time, yet, but it is at the point where feedback from peers would be helpful. This idea uses a bayesian cognitive framework to conceptualize the phenomena studied by information scientists.

The following is what I will be presenting.
>The bayesian definition of information (BDI) blends Bayesian models of cognition with Brookes’s fundamental equation of information science. It was created to present a stable unified definition of information that also allowed flexibility in studying information and information behavior. Information science and information behavior research has multiple functional definitions of information. These definitions often remain contextualized, rather than explicated, within the research itself, which has resulted in fractious interdisciplinary lens used when examining information.
>
 >The BDI has the potential to be a unifying definition for theorizing human interaction with information and the various behavior associated with such interactions. At its core the BDI is designed to define information in work examining knowledge transfer and information use in a variety of contexts and scopes. Initial work comparing the BDI to several existing definitions of information shows the possibility of the BDI’s utility for understanding complex phenomena of information.


## Changing Format

I was really excited to go to Portland. So when the organizers changed the conference to Online, you may have expected that I would be let down. However, before the change to online, I was going to have to cancel my trip and withdraw due to restrictions imposed as part of University's evolving policies around travel and COVID-19. However, the most important thing for me was to explore the BDI and meet other scholars. That will still happen in the online format. We'll see how it goes. I am excited.
