<h1>LIS 200-08 Phase 2 Recovery Plan</h1>
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>On <span style="color: red;">Date Needed<span>, I recorded a video that I posted. In this video I said that I would work with you to make sure you are successful in the class. I am committed to realizing this.</p>
<p>What I did not expect was for this to impact us as a community as deeply as it did. I know I have struggled to continue to  keep all the balls I am responsible for juggling up in the air, and I've spent nearly 15 years mastering and living a life based around self directed education and development. As a result of the issues so many of use have faced, and in fairness to all, I am proposing an amendment to the grading policies for class.</p>
<h2> Adoption of Changes <h2>
<p>Before I lay out these policies, I want to say the following, I think these are fair and adequate for  addressing the situation. However, I know that you may not feel the same way. I want you to know that I respect your opinions, and I want to make sure that you feel like you are being heard. These policies will be official, next Friday, April 24th, 2020. If I amend these changes, in response to your feedback those amendments will be final, on April 25th, 2020 at 11:59pm.</p>
<h2>Policy Changes<h2>
These changes are to the grading policy in the course syllabus. These changes are proposed only for this instance of the course. They create a set of brackets based on a student's submitted work, this alters the original grading policy, and creates the following categorical grading scheme:
<DL>
<DT>Cs</DT>
<DD>All students will receive a C+ for the completion of minor assignments. With allowances for up to 3 missing pieces of work/assignments.<ul><li>This will allow students who for other reasons are unable to complete major assignments to take advantage of university policies and protect their GPAs, and path towards graduation.</li></ul></DD>
<DT>Bs<DT>
<DD>Student who turn in a final research paper by 5/1/20 will be guaranteed a minimum B in the class. <i> <b>This offer is based on the assignment being submitted in earnest.*</b> Additionally, you should schedule a time to check your draft with the writing center. </i></DD>
<DT>A+s</DT>
<DD>Students who have submitted their draft document and completed the peer review assignment, upon submitting their final draft will receive full credit, A+ in the class. <span style="font-weight:bold;">This option is only available to students who submitted their assignments and have already been assigned peer reviewers. For the purposes of completion, the peer review assignment is unavailable for students who did not submit their draft before class last week.</span><dd>
<h2>What this requires from you</h2>
<p>First and foremost this means that you will want to submit any missing minor assignments and quizzes. As I mentioned above you can miss up to 3 of these assignments. However, while I will not subtract points unless you have more than 3 missing pieces of work, if you are missing more than 3 then I will subtract the total missing work from your grade. If you have concerns about your GPA at UNCG, then I would recommend completing the final paper. This will net you a 3.0 which may raise your overall average. Also see the caveat. If you are a student on path to finish the final paper as an ace, keep on the path and you will get an A+.</p>
<h3>Late Work Amnesty<h3>
<p>I will not be assigning any more work this term. You have until <B>May 3rd, 2020</B> to turn in any work, except the final paper. For assignments that required work turned in in-class, you may email me a photo of your work. From personal experience I recommend setting aside 30 minutes to an hour a day and working through any missing assignments until you are at 100%. If you wait until the last minute, you might not make it. </p>
<h3>Caveat<h3>
<p>Your minimum grade potential is outlined above, if your graded work score is higher than your bracketed score, you will receive that score. </p>
