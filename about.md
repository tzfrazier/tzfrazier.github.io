I am a Doctoral Candidate in Information Science researching the role the information and knowledge play in web work, digital creativity, and innovation. My dissertation examines the role that knowledge plays in the professional design of websites. I have worked as an Information Architect, Librarian, Bookseller, and in Radio. I'm looking for a role that involves research, problem solving, strategy, and conversations.
