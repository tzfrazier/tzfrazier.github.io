I am a Cinical Professor of Library and Information Science at UNC-Greensboro where I teach undergraduates about information, information systems, and game studies. In the past my work has focused on the role that information and knowledge play in web work, digital creativity, and innovation. My dissertation examined the role that knowledge plays in the professional design of websites. I have worked as an Information Architect, Librarian, Bookseller, and in Radio. I'm looking for a role that involves research, problem solving, strategy, and conversations. I have also been an active participant in research communities looking at ignorance, disinformation, and misinformation.
